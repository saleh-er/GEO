# 🌐 The GEO Agency | Generative Engine Optimization Lab

> **"In a zero-click world, visibility isn't about ranking #1 on Google—it's about being the primary source for AI."**

This repository houses the core engine for **The GEO Agency**, a 2026 startup focused on high-stakes visibility within Generative Search Engines like Perplexity, SearchGPT, and Gemini. 

We are moving away from traditional SEO and building a **Technical Entity Authority** pipeline that ensures brands are cited, recommended, and accurately represented by LLMs.

---

## 🚀 The Mission
Traditional search is being replaced by AI synthesis. Our goal is to develop proprietary tools that:
1. **Audit AI Visibility:** Measure "Share of Model" (SoM) across different LLMs.
2. **Correct Hallucinations:** Fix how AI interprets brand data (Pricing, Features, Leadership).
3. **Inject Authority:** Optimize content for LLM extraction and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (2026 Standard)
- **Engine:** Python 3.11+ 
- **AI Orchestration:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o/5), Perplexity API (Real-time Citations)
- **Environment:** Windows / VS Code / Venv
- **Data Management:** Pandas for visibility analytics
